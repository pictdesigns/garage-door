<p>That means if you left the lights on at home for 8 hours a day, led bulbs would last you almost ten years (3,125 days to be exact), clf bulbs would burn bright for 1,250 days, and incandescent bulbs would need to be changed after about 4 months. To avoid this, each bulb has a shunt of several turns of tiny wire inside the bulb near the bead. The power supply voltage may be too high. If your bulb is burning out in less than 6 months, try checking some of the factors mentioned above.</p>
