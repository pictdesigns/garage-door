<p>This is called remote jamming, car jamming or carjam. Watch how easy it is. Jammers are increasingly used to face rcied, remote controlled improvise explosive devices, to counter and protect citizens and infrastructure from threat. Electronic jamming is a warfare system that radiates the interfering signals towards the direction of the enemy’s radar. Now, imagine after experiencing such an ordeal, what it would be like to discover that your laptop or the expensive sports equipment that was stolen from your car, isn’t covered by your insurance policy because there. I�ve read suggestions that jamkazam is using udp (user datagram protocol) rather than tcp packets.</p>
