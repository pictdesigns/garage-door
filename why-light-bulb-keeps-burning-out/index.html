            <p>The light bulb is screwed in too tightly. This tab should have some spring to it.</p>


<p><strong>Why Light Bulb Keeps Burning Out</strong>, When this happens, the tab no longer makes sufficient contact with the bulb. A bulb can actually burn itself out by overheating, especially if it is in an enclosed or recessed light fixture. Halogen bulbs and sealed beam headlights have very fine tungsten wire filaments inside that emit light when heated.</p>

<center>Why Does My Light Bulb Keep Burning Out? From midpennelectrical.com</center>
<p>A bulb should be turned until it fits snugly into the fixture. Wear gloves or use a towel when you change the bulb. Frequent fixture vibration beyond the norm, though, can damage the filaments within the bulb and cause it to burn out more quickly. Therefore, the garage door opener must be mounted securely to prevent movement or vibration from damaging the light bulb.</p>

<p>A bulb should be turned until it fits snugly into the fixture. And if the circuit wiring were involved, other bulbs would be burning out too (from excessive ultra fast flickering). All good so i replaced all ballasts and bulbs. Powersuns are infamous for this and i did find a way to make them last. With the presence of moisture, it will eventually accumulate on the light bulb surface and blowing will occur. Needless to say, screwing the bulb tighter.</p>
